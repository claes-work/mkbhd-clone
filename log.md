## [2026-07-19] ingest | yt batch (@Waveform, 8) — first real ingest batch

First L2 ingest of the clone (corpus was 0 L2 before this). Stage B (P1-first) on
@Waveform, batch size 8: drained all 4 open @Waveform P1 rows — including the
fresh-upload P1 **"OnePlus is Dead… (In the US)" (2026-07-17)** — plus the 4 oldest P2
rows to fill the batch. All 8 had English captions; 0 no-captions, 0 duplicates, 0
skipped, no yt-dlp rate-limiting.

**Attribution (ensemble channel).** These are multi-host Waveform episodes and the
transcripts are auto-captions with **no speaker labels**, so per-line attribution is
inherently uncertain. Each page confines the "Notable verbatim quotes (Marques)" bank
to lines that are unambiguously his (first-person self-reference to his reviews/channel,
or a co-host addressing "Marques" adjacent to the line); everything else is quarantined
in an "Unattributed / other-speaker material" section flagged `attribution: uncertain`
and does **not** train the persona. Marques-attributed quote counts per page: MYrfLmm 3,
v4FYdo **0** (guest-led Retro Tech interview — correctly yielded no Marques voice data),
Kf-67zx 4, 1YO2 2, voXcln 4, Mwllur 2, YgMNE4 3, 63m_fs 4. Co-hosts/guests (Andrew
Manganelli, David Imel, Adam Molina, Mariah, and episode guests) already have — or should
get — `wiki/entities/` context pages, not persona lines.

Ledger: 8 rows @Waveform L0→L2. Open after: **P1 113** (@mkbhd 111 + @WaveformClips 2),
P2 ~2567, shorts 363. @WaveformClips still holds its own fresh-upload P1 clip
(yt-SyR7RrXkqSs) — intentionally left open because clips must be deduped against their
parent @Waveform episodes, which are not yet ingested. Ingest batches since last
synthesis: 1 (checkpoint at 10 — no synthesis due yet).

Synthesis notes: 7 of 8 pages carry ★ L3-candidate material (synthesis debt) — Marques's
**blind-smartphone-camera-test methodology** and the durable principle *correct exposure
beats over-brightness/over-saturation* (Pixel 6A/5A winning years running); his
**"peak smartphone" / physics-is-real, buy-a-dedicated-camera** argument and the
CEO-interview insight that only the hardest strategic/moral calls escalate to a CEO
(Tim Cook episode); the **small-OEM structural-margin** thesis (why Nothing can't make a
flagship) and **"paperware until it ships"** EV-startup skepticism (Slate/Faraday/Roadster);
his **"reverse inflation" on editing-hardware cost**; the **platform-must-auto-surface
AI/provenance labels** and **de-monetize stolen short-form** stances; and the
**"next big thing after the iPhone"** AI-hardware framing. Most are attribution-to-confirm
against his solo-channel audio before promotion. Guest-led Retro Tech episode: no
persona value.

## [2026-07-19] ingest | yt batch (@mkbhd, 8) — P1 solo main-channel batch

Stage B (P1-first) on **@mkbhd**, the main solo tech-review channel — the cleanest
Marques-attributed persona corpus. Batch size 8: drained the 8 oldest open P1 rows
(2013–2016 era). All 8 had English captions; **0 no-captions, 0 duplicates, 0 skipped,
no yt-dlp rate-limiting**. Second real ingest batch of the clone (16 L2 total now).

2015-12-30 Dope Tech: Best of 2015 · 2016-01-08 Dope Tech: CES 2016.

**Attribution (solo channel).** Unlike the @Waveform ensemble batch, these are
single-presenter @mkbhd videos: Marques narrates throughout, so every page is
`attribution: solo` and the full transcript is Marques voice/persona data — no per-line
quarantine needed. Watched for guests/collab: none. The CES 2016 show-floor episode was
checked specifically for on-mic booth reps/demoers — there are none (Marques references
other YouTubers but no one else is quoted), so it too stays solo. All 8 pages carry ★
L3-candidate material.

Ledger: 8 rows @mkbhd L0→L2. Open after: **P1 105** (@mkbhd 103 + @WaveformClips 2),
P2 ~2667, shorts 363. @WaveformClips still holds its 2 fresh-upload P1 clips —
intentionally left open (clips must be deduped against parent @Waveform episodes, not yet
ingested). Ingest batches since last synthesis: 2 (checkpoint at 10 — no synthesis due).

Synthesis notes: 8 of 8 pages carry ★ L3-candidate material (synthesis debt), all needing
promotion into persona/topics at the next checkpoint. Durable persona signal captured:
his **earliest solo review methodology** (iPhone 5s — Touch ID/M7/camera verdict framing,
Android-vs-iPhone even-handedness); the **"you're mostly paying for brand/marketing, and
that's not automatically wrong"** consumer-value framework (Beats by Dre, margins vs
perceived value); the founding of the **annual Smartphone Awards** format plus 2014 and
2015 category winners, and the award CRITERIA as durable review values (battery over
thinness, no-compromise flagships, value/pricing as first-class, stock-Android preference);
the launch of the **Dope Tech** gear-showcase series and his **red-and-black studio
aesthetic** / "Team Crispy" image-quality identity + RED Weapon/Dragon and the Sigma
18-35 f/1.8 as his signature lens (production-filmmaking) and early dbrand/ColorWare vendor
ties; his dislike of **"year of the X"** framing and early conviction on **USB-C
inevitability** and **Tesla fleet-learning Autopilot** (Best of 2015); and his **"CES = a
glimpse of the future, not a shopping list" / hardware-ahead-of-its-content** trade-show
philosophy plus an early **Chevy Bolt as first real Tesla rival** EV take (CES 2016).
These are the first main-channel persona anchors and should corroborate/date-stamp the
@Waveform debt at the next synthesis pass.

## [2026-07-19] ingest | yt batch (@mkbhd, 8) — P1 solo Dope Tech / iPhone 7 batch

Stage B (P1-first) on **@mkbhd**, the main solo tech-review channel. Batch size 8:
drained the next 8 oldest open P1 rows (all 2016) — seven **Dope Tech** episodes plus the
**iPhone 7 unboxing**. All 8 had English captions; **0 no-captions, 0 duplicates, 0
skipped, no yt-dlp rate-limiting**. Third real ingest batch of the clone (24 L2 total now).

HyperAdapt 1.0 · 2016-12-17 Dope Tech: Custom LED Clock.

**Attribution (solo channel).** All eight are single-presenter @mkbhd videos: Marques
narrates throughout, so every page is `attribution: solo` and the full transcript is
Marques voice/persona data — no per-line quarantine. Checked each for on-mic guests/
collaborators: none. People merely *referenced* but never heard on-mic (John of the "TLD"
channel re: the Orpheus and the HyperAdapt giveaway; the friend "Sam" who lent gear; the
person who lent the Nike Mag) were correctly left un-quarantined. The "Custom LED Clock"
turned out to be an off-the-shelf **LaMetric Time** he configures himself, not a
maker-built commission — still solo. No interview/collab episodes in this batch.

Ledger: 8 rows @mkbhd L0→L2. Open after: **P1 97** (@mkbhd 95 + @WaveformClips 2),
P2 ~2667 long-form, shorts 363. @WaveformClips still holds its 2 fresh-upload P1 clips —
intentionally left open (clips dedupe against parent @Waveform episodes, not yet
ingested). Ingest batches since last synthesis: 3 (checkpoint at 10 — no synthesis due).

Synthesis notes: 7 of 8 pages carry ★ L3-candidate material (synthesis debt); Nike Mag is
straight product coverage (no ★). Durable persona signal captured: his measured
**pre-iPhone-7 headphone-jack stance** (Lightning Headphones — concedes a matched Lightning
DAC can sound audibly better; objects on practical grounds, not audio quality) and the
**iPhone 7 headphone-jack-removal position** a month later (pragmatic/adapter-focused — the
$9 dongle replacement cost is the real friction, Lightning EarPods ≠ AirPods); his
**"shoot high-resolution now / cameras are computers attached to sensors"** production-craft
philosophy justifying 8K cinema-gear investment (RED Epic-W); the recurring **Dope Tech
format** as his vehicle for aspirational/novelty hardware (self-lacing Nike Mag & HyperAdapt
1.0, Boosted Board 2 e-mobility, high-end speakers, LaMetric clock); and his **jet-black vs
matte-black finish verdict** (special-edition jet black = scratch/fingerprint-prone; matte
= the "safe route") as an early durable review heuristic on premium finishes. All
attribution-clean (solo) and ready to corroborate/date-stamp the earlier @mkbhd + @Waveform
debt at the next synthesis pass.
